Using a SparkFun Qwiic 9DoF to control servos on two axes. Secondary code using a MAG3110 with a SparkFun Logic Level Translator.

I threw together a quick demo project, originally for the SparkFun 9DoF IMU Breakout - ICM-20948 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335), then rehashed with a SparkFun Triple Axis Magnetometer Breakout - MAG3110 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12670) to demonstrate the SparkFun Level Translator Breakout - PCA9306 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15439). The code is a little sloppy, but here it is, for those who are interested. Take it, pretty it up, change it, use it however you need. Just be aware that it does fall under the Beerware License, so if you find it useful, and you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the local, you buy us a round.
